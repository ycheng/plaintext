Plaintext

As I copy and paste between apps, from time to time I don't want the format to be pasted.
This app was inspire by an tiny app on OS X that transform the content on clip board into
plain text.

On the first version, I try to use QT5. I found the time to run the QT5 app is very slow
(like 0.3 seconds on my laptop). So I work out this, which cost only 0.041 seconds on my
laptop.

Enjoy it.
